Hello Gentlemen I have decided to make few not symmetric maps, and not log after that a cool idea of a symmetric map came to my mind so I am confused now Meanwhile I have Created the Dragon Tail map. It is called Dragon Tail because the circular cliff with its river is called so since the scavengers built their border through it in late 2100 They call is Dragon Tail because it looks a little bit like rolled tail of enormous dragon. And who knows what is it, and what was created and died after radiation The map is 180x180, and as few may say, finally not symmetric and for four players so the holiday is even bigger The map is 17 oils per player, four oils are available only by hovers or landing an engineer. Basic defence structures and very basic advanced bases are included. There is five oils in each base. Scavengers are included. They have very thin borderline but very well defended especially in terms of variety of almost all of their defence technology.

Here it is, as requested improved Dragon Tail V2 map  

It is identical as the original map with three small differences.

1) Scavengers have two oil derricks on the island in the very centre of the map.
2) Scavengers has two more factories, as a result there is four of them.
3) The cliffs near player 3 base were removed in three places to make the third base player easier way to the rest of the map.

Enjoy
