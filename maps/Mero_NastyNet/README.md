Hello Gentlemen  

Previously I assured there will be a break from circles and Arizona and there is  

The map is called Nasty Net from two obvious reasons  It is nasty and it is net in shape  

The net thing I donâ€™t have to explain  about "nasty" well.. try to play on it  and you will for sure understand  

The map is 200 x 200 again.. I promise I will try to change the size I often use next time.. 

The map is for 4 players, 5 oil in base, and another 17 around the map  and believe me it is worth visiting corners on some of my maps  Advanced bases included  the savage Scavengers are optional here too  

I have made the terrain as rich as possible in textures and features, but on such stripes of land it was hard.. so I tried not to overwhelm it  

Have fun on Nasty Net, and remember.. if all goes nasty.. it was intended  

Have fun  

Bye
