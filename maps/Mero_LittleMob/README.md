Hello Gentlemen,

The map is called Little Mob, because there is, a little mob.. of the trees on it.

The map is for four players. 65x65 so very small. 5 oils per player, and one extra oil in the very centre. Advanced basic bases included. I shall remain silent about the existence of the gateways soon.

Have fun,

Regards,
