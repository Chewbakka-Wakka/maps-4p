Hello gentlemen  

The map is called factory because it is one big factory  outside of which the players bases are placed  Maybe it is the biggest factory in Warzone history ??  

The map is for 4 players, it is 220 x 220 so finally different  I added extra 20 to make the factory as big as possible  

Advanced bases and scavengers included  but I want to inform you, that not all buildings which belongs to scavengers are the scavengers structures, by this I mean, I have added nice building called "cooling tower" to the map, it looks nice, especially on this factory map, but I have attached it to scavengers because if i have add it to the players they would see the map..

I wanted to see what happens if I add new thing, and how it works..  If you not turn on the scavengers, you will not see this new buildings at all  

The map is 5 oil in base and another 15 per player on the map  

With this map I wanted to achieve a spirit of very big factory  filled with concrete  I hope I managed.. The terrain outside the factory is natural, but with concrete border all changes into cold manufacturing factory  

I will make the version for 8 players now as the map is really big, but I wanted it to be so.

There is a lot of nice features on it, and multiple terraces  

Have fun
